# 🧠 AI Disease Prediction System

This project predicts possible diseases based on user-provided symptoms using a machine learning model. The app features a web interface and optionally includes Firebase for user authentication and data history.

## 🚀 Features

- ML model trained on symptom-disease mapping
- Predicts top 3 possible diseases with confidence
- Interactive UI (Streamlit or Flask-based)
- Firebase login (email/password or Google)
- User-specific prediction history
- Clean folder structure and modular code

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Joblib
- Streamlit or Flask (choose one)
- Firebase Auth + Realtime DB (optional)
- HTML/CSS/JS (for frontend with Flask)

## 🧪 Dataset

- `disease_dataset.xlsx` - Symptom to disease mappings

## 💻 How to Run
